This project is based on the original [GetKcal](https://github.com/maateusilva/getkcal) repository, created by Matheus Silva. The original project focuses on collecting user data to calculate basal metabolic rate (BMR) and recommend a calorie intake to achieve fitness goals.

In this modified version, instead of just providing BMR and calorie recommendations, the project integrates the OpenAI API to deliver a personalized workout plan, diet suggestions, and the daily amount of water the user should drink, based on the provided data.

## Features

- **User Data Collection**: Input your physical details and fitness goals.
- **BMR Calculation**: Calculates your basal metabolic rate to understand how many calories your body needs at rest.
- **Calorie Recommendation**: Provides a personalized calorie intake suggestion to help you achieve your fitness goals.
- **AI-Powered Workout Plan**: Receives a full 5-day workout plan generated by an AI, with both strength training (muscle building) and aerobic (cardio) options.

## How It Works

1. User inputs their personal information such as age, weight, height, and fitness goal.
2. The system calculates the userâ€™s BMR and suggests daily calorie intake.
3. The AI API generates a 5-day workout plan for the week, combining strength and cardio exercises.
4. The user receives both calorie recommendations and the workout plan to help achieve their fitness goals.

## Technologies Used

- **API Integration**: AI-powered API for workout generation
- **Fitness Calculations**: Basal metabolic rate and calorie needs calculation
